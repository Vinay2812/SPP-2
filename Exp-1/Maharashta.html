    <p>Maharashtra is a state in the
    western and central peninsular region of India occupying a substantial portion of the Deccan Plateau. Maharashtra is the
    second-most populous state in India as well as the second-most populous country subdivision in the world. It was formed
    on 1 May 1960 by splitting the bilingual Bombay State, which had existed since 1956, into majority Marathi-speaking
    Maharashtra and Gujarati-speaking Gujarat. Hence Maharashtra is a Marathi linguistic state. As the home of the Marathi
    people, Maharashtra is divided into 6 divisions and 36 districts, with the state capital being Mumbai, also the most
    populous urban area in India and Nagpur serving as the winter capital. The Godavari and the Krishna are the two major
    rivers in the state. Marathi is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state. The
    forest cover in the state is 16.47% of the state's geographical area. Out of the total cultivable land in Maharashtra,
    about 60% is used for grain crops with Jowar (Sorghum bicolor) being the dominating crop.

    Spread over 307,713 km2 (118,809 sq mi), Maharashtra is the third-largest state by area in India. It is bordered by the
    Arabian Sea to the west, the Indian states of Karnataka and Goa to the south, Telangana to the southeast and
    Chhattisgarh to the east, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh to the north, and the Indian union territory of Dadra and Nagar
    Haveli and Daman and Diu to the northwest.[11] Nagpur hosts the winter session of the state legislature.[12] The state
    has three international airports, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (Mumbai), Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar
    International Airport (Nagpur), and Pune Airport (Lohegaon, Pune). The state is home to three railways headquarters viz.
    Central Railway (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus), Konkan Railway (CBD Belapur) and Western Railway (Churchgate).
    The High Court of the state viz. Bombay High Court is located in Mumbai. The state contributes 48 seats and 19 seats to
    the lower house Lok Sabha and to the upper house Rajya Sabha, respectively. President's rule has been imposed in
    Maharashtra three times since 1980, for different reasons and for a total of 156 days. Hinduism is practised by more
    than three-fourths of the population, followed by Islam and Buddhism. The predominant ethnolinguistic group of the

    The Maratha Empire was the prominent kingdom based in Maharashtra. Prior to Indian independence, the state was ruled by
    the Satavahana dynasty, Rashtrakuta dynasty, Western Chalukyas, Deccan sultanates, Mughals, and the British. Ruins,
    monuments, tombs, forts, and places of worship left by these rulers are dotted around the state. At the time of Indian
    independence movement in the early 20th century, there were two major princely states in Maharashtra: Deccan and
    Kolhapur. The state is home to four UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Ajanta, Ellora and Elephanta caves and the Chhatrapati
    Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus). Pune is known as the 'Oxford of the East' due to the presence of
    several well-known educational institutions.[13][14] Nashik is known as the 'Wine Capital of India' as it has the
    largest number of wineries and vineyards in the country. Maharashtra provides legal protection to its tiger population
    through six dedicated tiger reserves under the precincts of the National Tiger Conservation Authority.
