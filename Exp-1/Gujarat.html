    Gujarat (/ˌɡʊdʒəˈrɑːt/, Gujarati: [ˈɡudʒəɾɑt] (About this soundlisten)) is a state on the western coast of India with a
    coastline of 1,600 km (990 mi) – most of which lies on the Kathiawar peninsula – and a population of 60.4 million. It is
    the fifth-largest Indian state by area and the ninth-largest state by population. Gujarat is bordered by Rajasthan to
    the northeast, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the south, Maharashtra to the southeast, Madhya Pradesh to
    the east, and the Arabian Sea and the Pakistani province of Sindh to the west. Its capital city is Gandhinagar, while
    its largest city is Ahmedabad.[9] The Gujarati people of India are indigenous to the state and their language, Gujarati,
    is the state's official language. The economy of Gujarat is the fifth-largest in India, with a gross state domestic
    product (GSDP) of ₹16.48 trillion (US$220 billion) and has the country's 10th-highest GSDP per capita of ₹243,761
    (US$3,200).[1] Gujarat ranks 21st among Indian states in human development index.[4] The state traditionally has low
    unemployment and is widely considered one of the most industrially developed states of India and a manufacturing hub.

The state encompasses 23 sites of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation (more than any other state). The most important
sites are Lothal (the world's first dry dock), Dholavira (the fifth largest site), and Gola Dhoro (where 5 uncommon
seals were found). Lothal is believed to have been one of the world's first seaports.[14] Gujarat's coastal cities,
chiefly Bharuch and Khambhat,[15] served as ports and trading centres in the Maurya and Gupta empires, and during the
succession of royal Saka dynasties in the Western Satraps era.[16][17] Along with Bihar, Mizoram and Nagaland, Gujarat
is one of four Indian states to prohibit the sale of alcohol.[18] The Gir Forest National Park in Gujarat is home to the
only wild population of the Asiatic lion in the world</p>
