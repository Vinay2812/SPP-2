        <h1><em><u>Madhya Pradesh</u></em></h1>
    </center>
Madhya Pradesh (/ˌmədjə prəˈdɛʃ/,[10] Hindi: [ˈməd̪ʱjə pɾəˈdeːʃ] (About this soundlisten); meaning Central Province) is
a state in central India. Its capital is Bhopal, and the largest city is Indore, with Jabalpur, Ujjain, Gwalior, Satna
being the other major cities. Madhya Pradesh is the second largest Indian state by area and the fifth largest state by
population with over 72 million residents. It borders the states of Uttar Pradesh to the northeast, Chhattisgarh to the
southeast, Maharashtra to the south, Gujarat to the west, and Rajasthan to the northwest.[11]

The area covered by the present-day Madhya Pradesh includes the area of the ancient Avanti Mahajanapada, whose capital
Ujjain (also known as Avantika) arose as a major city during the second wave of Indian urbanisation in the sixth century
BCE. Subsequently, the region was ruled by the major dynasties of India. The Maratha empire dominated the majority of
the 18th century. After the Anglo-Maratha Wars in the 19th century, the region was divided into several princely states
under the British and incorporated into Central Provinces and Berar and the Central India Agency.

After India's independence, Madhya Pradesh state was created with Nagpur as its capital: this state included the
southern parts of the present-day Madhya Pradesh and northeastern portion of today's Maharashtra. In 1956, this state
was reorganised and its parts were combined with the states of Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh and Bhopal to form the new
Madhya Pradesh state, the Marathi-speaking Vidarbha region was removed and merged with the Bombay State. This state was
the largest in India by area until 2000, when its southeastern Chhattisgarh region was designated a separate state.

Indian states in human development index.[12] Rich in mineral resources, Madhya Pradesh has the largest reserves of
diamond and copper in India. More than 30% of its area is under forest cover. Its tourism industry has seen considerable
growth, with the state topping the National Tourism Awards in 2010–11.[13] In recent years, the state's GDP growth has
been above the national average.[14] In 2019–20, state's GSDP was recorded at 9.07.</p>
