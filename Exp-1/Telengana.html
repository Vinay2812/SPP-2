Telangana (/ˌtɛlənˈɡɑːnə/ (About this soundlisten), Telugu: [ˈtelaŋɡaːɳa], Urdu: [ˈtɪləŋɡɑːna]) is a state in India
situated on the south-central stretch of the Indian peninsula on the high Deccan Plateau.[10] It is the eleventh-largest
state and the twelfth-most populated state in India with a geographical area of 112,077 km2 (43,273 sq mi) and
35,193,978 residents as per 2011 census.[11] On 2 June 2014, the area was separated from the northwestern part of Andhra
Pradesh as the newly formed state with Hyderabad as its capital. Its other major cities include Warangal, Nizamabad,
Khammam, Karimnagar and Ramagundam. Telangana is bordered by the states of Maharashtra to the north, Chhattisgarh to the
northeast, Karnataka to the west, and Andhra Pradesh to the east and south.[12] The terrain of Telangana region consists
mostly of hills, mountain ranges, and thick dense forests covering an area of 27,292 km2 (10,538 sq mi). As of 2019, the
state of Telangana is divided into 33 districts.

Throughout antiquity and the Middle Ages, the region now known as Telangana was ruled by multiple major Indian powers
such as the Mauryans, Satavahanas, Vishnukundinas, Chalukyas, Cholas, Rashtrakutas, Kakatiyas, Delhi Sultanate, Bahmani
Sultanate, Golconda Sultanate. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the region was ruled by the Mughals of India.[13] The
region is known for its Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb culture.[14] During the 18th century and the British Raj, Telangana was
ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad.[15] In 1823, the Nizams lost control over Northern Circars (Coastal Andhra) and Ceded
Districts (Rayalseema), which were handed over to the East India Company. The annexation by the British of the Northern
Circars deprived Hyderabad State, the Nizam's dominion, of the considerable coastline it formerly had, to that of a
landlocked princely state with territories in the central Deccan, bounded on all sides by British India. Thereafter, the
Northern Circars were governed as part of Madras Presidency until India's independence in 1947, after which the
presidency became India's Madras state.

The Hyderabad state joined the Union of India in 1948 after an Indian military invasion. In 1956, the Hyderabad State
was dissolved as part of the linguistic reorganisation of states and Telangana was merged with the Telugu-speaking
Andhra State (part of the Madras Presidency during the British Raj) to form Andhra Pradesh. A peasant-driven movement
began to advocate for separation from Andhra Pradesh starting in the early 1950s, and continued until Telangana was
granted statehood on 2 June 2014 under the leadership of K. Chandrashekar Rao.[17]

The economy of Telangana is the seventh-largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹9.78 trillion
(US$130 billion) and has the country's 6th-highest GSDP per capita of ₹249,000 (US$3,300).[3] Telangana ranks 22nd among
Indian states in human development index.[6] The state has emerged as a major focus for robust IT software, industry and
services sector. The state is also the main administrative centre of many Indian defence aerospace and research labs
like Bharat Dynamics Limited, Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory, Defence Research and Development Organisation
and Defence Research and Development Laboratory.[18]

Hyderabadi cuisine and Kakatiya architecture both from Telangana, are on the list of UNESCO creative city of gastronomy
and UNESCO World Heritage Site. The cultural centers of Telangana, Hyderabad and Warangal, are noted for their wealth
and renowned historical structures – Ramappa Temple (UNESCO World Heritage Site), Charminar, Qutb Shahi Tombs, Falaknuma
Palace, Chowmahalla Palace, Warangal Fort, Kakatiya Kala Thoranam, Thousand Pillar Temple and the Bhongir Fort in
Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district. The historic city Golconda in Hyderabad established itself as a diamond trading centre
and, until the end of the 19th century, the Golconda market was the primary source of the finest and largest diamonds in
the world. Thus, the legendary name Golconda Diamonds became synonymous with Golconda itself. Religious edifices like
the Lakshmi Narasimha Temple in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district, Makkah Masjid in Hyderabad, the ancient Bhadrakali Temple
and Govinda Rajula Gutta in Warangal, Alampur Jogulamba Temple in Jogulamba Gadwal district and Medak Cathedral, Lord
