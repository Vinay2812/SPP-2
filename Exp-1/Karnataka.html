    <p>Karnataka (/kərˈnɑːtəkə/; ISO: Karnāṭaka, Kannada pronunciation: [kəɾˈnɑːʈəkɑ]) is a state in South India. The state
    lies in the south-western region of the Indian peninsula. It was formed on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the
    States Reorganisation Act. Originally known as the State of Mysore /maɪˈsɔːr/, it was renamed Karnataka in 1973. The
    state corresponds to the Carnatic region. Its capital and largest city is Bangalore.
    <br><br>
    Karnataka is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, Goa to the northwest, Maharashtra to the north, Telangana to the
    northeast, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the southeast, and Kerala to the southwest. It is the only southern
    state to have land borders with all of the other 4 southern Indian sister states. The state covers an area of 191,791
    square kilometres (74,051 sq mi), or 5.83 percent of the total geographical area of India.[10] It is the sixth largest
    Indian state by area.[10] With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the eighth largest state by
    population, comprising 31 districts. Kannada, one of the classical languages of India, is the most widely spoken and
    official language of the state. Other minority languages spoken include Urdu, Konkani, Marathi, Tulu, Tamil, Telugu,
    Malayalam, Kodava and Beary. Karnataka also contains some of the only villages in India where Sanskrit is primarily
    spoken

Though several etymologies have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that Karnataka is
derived from the Kannada words karu and nādu, meaning "elevated land". Karu Nadu may also be read as karu, meaning
"black" and nadu, meaning "region", as a reference to the black cotton soil found in the Bayalu Seeme region of the
state. The British used the word Carnatic, sometimes Karnatak, to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the
Krishna.[14]

With an antiquity that dates to the paleolithic, Karnataka has been home to some of the most powerful empires of ancient
and medieval India. The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary
movements which have endured to the present day. Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian
classical music, the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions.

The economy of Karnataka is the Sixth-largest of any Indian state with ₹16.39 trillion (US$220 billion) in gross
domestic product and a per capita GDP of ₹231,000 (US$3,100).[15][16] Karnataka has the nineteenth highest ranking among
Indian states in Human Development Index.</p>
